# UnaCloud
## Overview
UnaCloud is a project developed by the research group COMIT (Comunicaciones y Tecnología de Información) from Universidad de los Andes, Colombia. It is an open source opportunistic cloud computing Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) implementation which provides basic computing resources (processing, storage, and networking) to run arbitrary software, including operating systems and applications.

UnaCloud is able to execute single instances and/or clusters of virtual machines. Its execution is mostly supported by off-the-shelf, volatile, non-dedicated, distributed, and heterogeneous computing resources (such as desktops) that belong to a variety of administrative domains on a university campus.

UnaCloud is a Client-Server application which can be used currently in desktops with Windows or Linux (Debian, Ubuntu) operating systems. 

## Features
UnaCloud uses virtualization as a strategy to enable on-demand deployments of customized execution environments. These environments can meet complex software and hardware requirements from several research projects. UnaCloud uses type-2 hypervisors to isolate the end-user environment from another one based on, and dedicated to, harvesting idle computing resources.

In addition, UnaCloud executes instances as independent idle-priority processes that run in background. This strategy allows the operating system to assign CPU time slices to higher-priority processes (e.g. foreground normal- priority processes executed by end-users). Both deployment strategies, virtualization and idle- priority execution, enable harvesting idle computing resources opportunistically, that is, execution instances are executed when an end-user is using the desktop or when it is fully idle (e.g. at night or during weekends when the computer laboratories are closed to the public).

It is important to clarify that instead of volunteering their desktops, end-users in UnaCloud are unaware of the opportunistic use of machines available in computer laboratories. Indeed, UnaCloud is always ready to stealthily execute instances on demand. As a result, the design specifications of UnaCloud strongly consider slowdown, since it is executed on laboratories that are mainly used by university students working on their daily activities. The proposed solution was implemented and tested through the deployment of an opportunistic IaaS model, showing high efficiency in supporting academic and scientific projects.

Among its features, UnaCloud allows the user to deploy a large number of instances (eg. 100) using one from two different available protocols, TCP or P2P.

You can find three different options: Manual Installation, Script-based Installation (Ubuntu or Debian) or Vagrant Installation(VirtualBox).

## Pre-Configuration
After downloading project, modify configuration file config.properties (for all installation options).
Note: Vagrant Installation Option configuration file has default values currently, we recommend at least to change passwords in file and IP_FOR_UNACLOUD word in WEB_FILE_SERVER_URL, CONTROL_SERVER_IP y FILE_SERVER_IP variables by IP address defined for UnaCloud Server.

## Configuration
### Agent
To add an Agent to UnaCloud you should create a PhysicalMachine in UnaCloud. 
* Access to UnaCloud with admin user.
* Create a Laboratory if you don't have one.
* Add a new PhysicalMachine with values from real PhysicalMachine including IP address, hostname and MAC address.
* Machine will appear with a red label with value OFF.

Access to menu Configuration > Agent management and select Download from Download Agent Files section. This package contains:
* ClientUpdater.jar: application to download and update agent from server.
* Global.properties: configuration file with variables to connect with server services.
* Local.properties: configuration file to set local environment variables.

Unzip files in physical machine (host) and allocate them in path of your preference. Next modify file local.properties:
* VBOX_PATH: VBoxManage application path
* VMRUN_PATH: vmrun.exe application path
* VM_REPO_PATH: local repository path. Path of your preference.
* DATA_PATH: logs folder path. Path of your preference.

Use slash character before ":" and "\"
```
DATA_PATH=E\:\\
VM_REPO_PATH=E\:\\GRID
VMRUN_PATH=C\:\\Program Files (x86)\\VMware\\VMware VIX\\vmrun.exe
VBOX_PATH=C\:\\Program Files\\Oracle\\VirtualBox\\VBoxManage.exe
```

Finally, when the configuration process is finished, you must add the ClientUpdater.jar file as a boot script, following these steps:

#### Windows
* Create a text file that includes following commands in order to change the path and execute the client updater jar. Save it as a .bat file, i.e startUnacloud.bat.
```
cd C:\UnaCloud\

java –jar ClientUpdater.jar 1
```
* Open the Local Group Policy Editor (Type gpedit.msc from the start menu)
* In the console tree, click Scripts (Startup/Shutdown). The path is Computer Configuration\Windows Settings\Scripts (Startup/Shutdown)
* Click Startup and then Add
* Insert the path of your .bat file on script name.
* Click ok and then ok. The next time that you restart the machine, it will start with UnaCloud Agent.

#### Linux
* Create a text file that includes following commands in order to change the path and execute the client updater jar. Save it as a .bash file, i.e startUnacloud.bash.
```
#!/bin/sh
cd /etc/UnaCloud/

java –jar ClientUpdater.jar 1
```
* Change priviligies on script only for root user
* Configure startup execution for script through rc.local file or /etc/init folder. This configuration depends of your operating system version, please check official manual.
* Check again if your Java is installed correctly using "java -version" command.
