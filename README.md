#UnaCloud 2
##Overview
UnaCloud is a project developed by the investigation group COMIT (Comunicaciones y Tecnología de Información) from Universidad de los Andes, Colombia. It is an open source opportunistic cloud computing Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) implementation which provides basic computing resources (processing, storage, and networking) to run arbitrary software, including operating systems and applications.

UnaCloud is able to execute single instances and/or clusters of virtual machines. Its execution is mostly supported by off-the-shelf, volatile, non-dedicated, distributed, and heterogeneous computing resources (such as desktops) that belong to a variety of administrative domains on a university campus.

##Features
UnaCloud uses virtualization as a strategy to enable on-demand deployments of customized execution environments. These environments can meet complex software and hardware requirements from several research projects. UnaCloud uses type-2 hypervisors to isolate the end-user environment from another one based on, and dedicated to, harvesting idle computing resources.

In addition, UnaCloud executes virtual machines as independent idle-priority processes that run in background. This strategy allows the operating system to assign CPU time slices to higher-priority processes (e.g. foreground normal- priority processes executed by end-users). Both deployment strategies, virtualization and idle- priority execution, enable harvesting idle computing resources opportunistically, that is, virtual machines execute when an end-user is utilizing the desktop or when it is fully idle (e.g. at night or during weekends when the computer laboratories are closed to the public).

It is important to clarify that instead of volunteering their desktops, end-users in UnaCloud are unaware of the opportunistic use of desktops available in computer laboratories. Indeed, UnaCloud is always ready to stealthily execute virtual machines on demand. As a result, the design specifications of UnaCloud strongly consider slowdown, since it executes on laboratories that are mainly used by university students to do their daily work. The proposed solution was implemented and tested through the deployment of an opportunistic IaaS model, showing high efficiency in supporting academic and scientific projects.

##Using UnaCloud
Unacloud has three main functional entities: Clusters, Images and Virtual Machines. Virtual Machine Images are the AMI equivalent in the AWS EC2, and each one represents the virtual machine files that will be copied and deployed in the physical machines. A cluster is an image aggrupation, which allows making deployments of different images at once (like needed in a master-slave cluster schema). Finally, a virtual machine is an image already in execution.

##Research
UnaCloud is based on research publications, that were made by members of investigation group COMMIT from Universidad de los Andes, which develop, analyze and expose the features of implementation in order to involve the better policies to service of UnaCloud.
